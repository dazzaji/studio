# USED MUSIC GEAR - PRICE ESTIMATES

## GUITAR 

The guitar shown in the images is an Ibanez GRG7221QA 7-string electric guitar in Transparent Blue Burst. Based on its mint condition and recent purchase, here is an estimate of what you might expect when selling it to a local music store:

### **Resale Value Estimate**
1. **New Price**: This model typically retails for around $300 new[3].
2. **Used Market Value**: Mint-condition used versions of this guitar generally sell for $200–$250 on platforms like Craigslist or Reverb[5].
3. **Local Music Store Offer**: Local stores, including Guitar Center, usually offer 40–60% of the resale value for used gear, depending on demand and condition[7][10][11]. For this guitar, you can expect an offer of $80–$150.

### **Factors Affecting Value**
- **Condition**: Your guitar is described as mint, which may push the offer closer to the higher end of the range.
- **Store Policy**: Some stores may offer slightly more if you trade the guitar in for other equipment rather than taking cash[7].
- **Demand**: If there is low demand for entry-level 7-string guitars locally, the offer may be lower.

### **Recommendation**
If maximizing profit is your goal, consider selling directly to individuals via platforms like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, where you could aim for $200–$250. Selling to a store is faster but less lucrative due to their lower offers.

## AMP

The Fender Mustang LT25 amp you own is in mint condition and has only been used twice, which increases its resale value. Here’s an overview of its potential selling price:

### **Resale Value**
1. **Retail Price**: The new price for the Mustang LT25 currently ranges from $149.99 to $179.99[4].
2. **Used Market**: Used models are typically sold for around $99 to $109.99, depending on condition and demand[3][4].

### **Selling to a Local Music Store**
Music stores generally offer 25–50% of what they plan to sell the item for[5][8]. If a store expects to sell the amp for $100–$110, you can anticipate an offer of $50–$55, possibly up to $60 if demand is high.

### **Alternative Selling Options**
- **Direct Sale**: Platforms like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace can allow you to sell directly to buyers, potentially fetching closer to $80–$100.
- **Trade-In Credit**: Stores like Guitar Center may offer slightly better value if you use the trade-in credit toward purchasing new gear[7].

If maximizing profit is your goal, consider selling directly to local buyers or online marketplaces. However, if convenience matters more, a local music store should provide a quick transaction at a reasonable price.

# Bass and Base Case

Based on the images and available retail prices:

1. **Low-End 5-String Bass Guitar**: This appears to be a budget 5-string bass guitar, likely priced around **$200–$300**, depending on the brand and condition. Entry-level models from brands like Ibanez or similar generic brands fall within this range.

2. **Poor-Quality Bass Case**: A basic gig bag for bass guitars typically retails for approximately **$20–$40**, especially for lightweight, non-padded options.

### Estimated Total Retail Price:
The combined retail price for the bass guitar and case would be roughly **$220–$340**.
